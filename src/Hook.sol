     * @notice Hook executed before a swap — applies sell-side tax logic when conditions are met.
     * @dev
     * This function is called by the Uniswap V4 PoolManager **before** executing a swap.
     * It identifies whether the fundraising token is being **sold** (swapped out of the pool) and,
     * if so, deducts a protocol-defined fee which is sent directly to the treasury wallet.
     *
     * The function uses `tx.origin` instead of `msg.sender` because Uniswap’s router
     * contract typically calls the pool on behalf of the end user — `tx.origin`
     * ensures the actual swap initiator is checked against taxation rules.
     *
     * ### Key Behavior:
     * - Detects **sell transactions** by comparing `zeroForOne` with token ordering.
     * - Calls `checkIfTaxIncurred` to determine if the tax mechanism is active.
     * - Calculates and deducts the fee based on `TAX_FEE_PERCENTAGE / TAX_FEE_DENOMINATOR`.
     * - Transfers the deducted fee to `treasuryAddress` via `poolManager.take`.
     * - Returns a `BeforeSwapDelta` reflecting the amount deducted before swap execution.
     *
     * @param key The Uniswap V4 pool key containing currencies, fee tier, and hook configuration.
     * @param params Swap parameters indicating direction, amount, and bounds.
     * @param (unused) Extra calldata (kept for hook interface compatibility).
     *
     * @return selector Always returns `BaseHook.beforeSwap.selector` to signal successful execution.
     * @return returnDelta Struct specifying the deducted fee amount before swap execution.
     * @return fee Additional Uniswap fee parameter (always 0; taxation handled via delta).
     *
     * @custom:reverts FeeToLarge If the computed fee exceeds the int128 limit (for Uniswap deltas).
     * @custom:security
     * - Uses `tx.origin` to reference the actual user rather than the router contract.
     * - Ensures only valid sell transactions trigger taxation.
     * - Fee flows directly to `treasuryAddress`, which must be trusted and controlled by governance.
     * - Prevents overflow in signed integer conversions.
